const story = `Ashravan’s eyes fluttered open, the world around him a blur of colors and sound. Shai’s restoration had been a miracle, yet he felt an emptiness, a void that no magic could fill. As he sat up, memories flooded back—the battle, the sacrifice, the hope. But something was different now. He was no longer the same Ashravan, the warrior who fought for survival; he had become something more, something fragile yet resilient.

He rose slowly, feeling the weight of his new life. Shadows loomed at the edges of his mind, whispering doubts. But Shai’s kindness had rekindled a spark within him, a desire to protect those he loved. The city around him buzzed with life, unaware of the darkness that once threatened to consume it.

Suddenly, a distant cry pierced the air—a child in danger. Without hesitation, Ashravan sprinted toward the sound, determination etched on his face. As he reached the scene, he saw chaos: a collapsing building, frightened civilians, and a looming threat. He leapt into action, risking everything to save the innocent.

In that moment, Ashravan realized that his purpose was no longer just about survival, but about hope. The city had given him a second chance, and he would stand as its guardian. The climax built—an explosion, a choice—would he risk himself to save the many or retreat to safety? His decision echoed his rebirth: to fight, to protect, to become a hero once more. And as the dust settled, Ashravan knew he had found his true destiny.`
